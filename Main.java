// Project Name: Projected Salary Calculator
// Description: My program, Projected Salary Calculator, calculates an employeeâ€™s future salary (monthly and annual) after a specified number of years. It considers factors such as current salary, annual raises, and taxes. My program aims to help employees project their financial growth.
